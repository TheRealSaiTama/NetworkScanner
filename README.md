## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Specifications

### System Requirements

- **OS Support**: Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher (3.10+ recommended for optimal performance)
- **Memory**: 256MB minimum, 1GB+ recommended for enterprise networks
- **Privileges**: Admin/root for raw packet operations (CAP_NET_RAW on Linux)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository with depth optimization
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/TheRealSaiTama/NetworkScanner.git
cd NetworkScanner

# Install dependencies with integrity verification
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Linux/macOS: Set capabilities (alternative to running with sudo)
sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep $(which python3)

# Windows: Install Npcap from https://npcap.com/ (required for packet capture)
```

### Command-Line Interface (for Automation & DevSecOps Integration)

```bash
python main.py --cli <ip_range> [options]
```

**Advanced Options:**
- `-p, --ports`: Target specific ports (e.g., "22,80,1-1024,3389")
- `-t, --threads`: Parallel scanning threads (default: auto-optimized)
- `-o, --output`: Output file path and base name
- `--format`: Output format selection (csv, json, pdf, all)
- `-s, --sort`: Sort results by (ip, mac, ports, risk)
- `-f, --filter`: Filter expression (e.g., "ports > 10 and mac != 'unknown'")
- `--stealth`: Engage reduced footprint scanning mode
- `--periodic`: Schedule recurring scans (e.g., "1h", "30m", "daily")
- `--diff`: Compare against previous scan results
- `-v, --verbose`: Detailed operational output

**Example (Enterprise Scan):**
```bash
python main.py --cli 10.0.0.0/16 -p common,custom -t 50 -o quarterly_audit --format all --stealth
```

### Graphical Interface (for Interactive Analysis)

```bash
python main.py --gui
# or simply
python main.py
```
